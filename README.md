 # 0xBooper's scripts.
 
 (These scripts can be used standalone, but you should use this with my dotfiles.)
 
 This is a collection of various scripts I have made. A list of needed dependencies for each script can be found under the shebang of the script. All scripts are ***bash*** scripts, so they should work.
